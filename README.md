This repository contains code for a bot to learn to beat Flappy Bird using machine learning techniques, inspired by CodeBullet. It was coded in Processing (which is essentially Java with simplified graphics tools).

The game was coded from scratch, as was the bot. To make it more similar to the real game, one can load in the images from the images folder, if they so wish.

The Masterscript folder also contains a playable version of the game, for people to enjoy.
