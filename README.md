This repository contains code for a user to both play Flappy Bird and create a perceptron that will learn to beat the game. This was inspired by CodeBullet's youtube video and was coded in Processing to make use of the simplified graphics tools.

The game was coded from scratch, as was the bot. To make it more similar to the real game, one can load in the images from the images folder, if they so wish.
